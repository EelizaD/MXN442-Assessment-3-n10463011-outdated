The five files contain the code for the classification models using random forests, KNN, and ANN, and the model reduction on the random forests model. 
The file names contain the algorithm used (random forests, KNN, ANN), and the random forest files contain the model reduction. The random forest files have been split into the three
different classification levels (RF2, RF3, RF4). However, the KNN and ANN files do all three types of models in the one code. Each file can be run separately.
